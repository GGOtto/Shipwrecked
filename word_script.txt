Version 3.1: 1-10||"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."|The Fellowship of the Ring||"I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one hundred percent."|Horton Hatches the Egg||"I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship."|Little Women||"Why, sometimes, I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."|Through the Looking-Glass||It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone||"Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?"|Anne of Green Gables||We dream in our waking moments, and walk in our sleep.|The Scarlet Letter||All human wisdom is summed up in these two words: Wait and hope.|The Count of Monte Cristo||"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep."|William Shakespeare, The Tempest
2-5||"I must confess, I cannot deny it, that I am deeply disappointed in the results of the operation," came the answer.|Prince Caspian||"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed, or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone||"This above all: To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."|William Shakespeare, Hamlet||"Life, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself."|A Wrinkle in Time||"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts."|William Shakespeare, As You Like It
3-5||Rounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of a handsome, dignified house of mellowed red brick, with well kept lawns reaching down to the water's edge.|The Wind in the Willows||Once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from the keen wind and whirling snow.|The Wind in the Willows||It's never the wrong time to call on Toad. Early or late he's always the same fellow. Always good tempered, always glad to see you, always sorry when you go!|The Wind in the Willows||No man, for any considerable period of time, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.|The Scarlet Letter||"Why did you do all this for me?" he asked. "I don't deserve it. I've never done anything for you." "You have been my friend," replied Charlotte. "That in itself is a tremendous thing."|Charlotte's Web
4-6||Here he paused, and taking his cross-bow from where he kept it concealed under his long tabard, he prepared it for instant action, and went forward once more with greater resolution and assurance. The path led him straight to the group of buildings.|The Black Arrow||Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made me another table.|Robinson Crusoe||Danny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main-rigging (this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the reeling cross-trees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black buoy-flag on the shoulder of a mile-away swell.|Captains Courageous||It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine.|The Call of the Wild||For what seemed hours, the ship plowed through wave after wave, trembling, careening on its side, yet somehow managing to stay afloat. The long streaks of lightning never diminished; zigzagging through the sky, their sharp cracks resounding on the water.|The Black Stallion||"And books! Thomson, Cowper, Scott, she would buy them all over and over again; she would buy up every copy to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree."|Sense and Sensibility
5-7||We soon arrived at the guava trees, and a little after at the spot where we had left the sledge, when we found our treasures in the best possible condition; but as the morning was not far advanced, we entered upon our intended project of penetrating beyond the wall of rocks.|The Swiss Family Robinson||They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a flicker of sickly sun from time to time, that made patches of olive-green water. Then a stump foremast lifted, ducked, and disappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with old fashioned wooden snail's horn davits. The sails were red tanned.|Captains Courageous||The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.|Animal Farm||All the way home my dogs kept running out in front of me. They would stop, turn around, and look at me. I had to smile, for I knew what they wanted. I stopped and petted them a little and told them that as soon as I got home and had my supper, we would go hunting.|Where the Red Fern Grows||Something in the utterance attracted his attention; it might have been the tone, it might have been the wish. The smallest bird cannot light upon the greatest tree without sending a shock to its most distant fibre; every mind is at times no less sensitive to the most trifling words.|Ben-Hur||"You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest."|The Importance of Being Earnest||"All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring; renewed shall be the blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king."|The Fellowship of the Ring
6-4||Unfortunately, the weather changed sooner than we expected, and than, with all our care, we could be prepared for: before we had completed our winter establishment, the rain fell in such heavy torrents that I could not refrain from painful apprehension in surmising how we should resist such a body of water, that seemed to change the whole face of the country into a lake.|The Swiss Family Robinson||And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind out of her sails. She came round into the wind like a top, and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.|Kidnapped||Night fell as we were walking, and the clouds, which had been broken up in the afternoon, settled in and thickened, so that it fell, for the season of the year, extremely dark. The way we went was over rough mountainsides, and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner, I could by no means see how he directed himself.|Kidnapped||"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair."|A Tale of Two Cities
7-4||I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure. The first part of it, which was the great bulk of it, was parchment, and yellow with age. I scanned a leaf particularly, and I saw that it was a palimpsest. Under the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still, Latin words and sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.|A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court||The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a ploughed field; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.|Black Beauty||It was pleasanter at home, when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit hole, and yet, it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. I do wonder what can have happened to me. When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one.|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland||The full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude with its light. We are not conscious of daylight as that which displaces darkness. Daylight, even when the sun is clear of clouds, seems to us simply the natural condition of the earth and air. When we think of the downs, we think of the downs in daylight, as we think of a rabbit with its fur on.|Watership Down
8-2||It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....|Star Wars, A New Hope||The nearer cliffs, at each side of the bay, were streaked here and there with lines of white which everyone knew to be waterfalls, though at that distance they did not show any movement or make any noise. Indeed the whole place was very silent and the water of the bay as smooth as glass. It reflected every detail of the cliffs. The scene would have been rather pretty in a picture but was rather opressive in real life. It was not a country that welcomed visitors.|The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
9-2||At first Shasta could see nothing in the valley below him but a sea of mist with a few domes and pinnacles rising from it; but as the light increased and the mist cleared away he saw more and more. A broad river divided itself into two streams and on the island between them stood the city of Tashbaan, one of the wonders of the world. Round the very edge of the island, so that the water lapped against the stone, ran high walls strengthened with so many towers that he soon gave up trying to count them.|The Horse and His Boy||As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I saw a man, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, What shall I do?|The Pilgrim's Progress
10-2||The appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast. Gray-colored woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, outtopping the others, some singly, some in clumps; but the general coloring was uniform and sad.|Treasure Island||It was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore them down. When they made Dawson, they should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at least. But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did their best for the animals.|The Call of The Wild
